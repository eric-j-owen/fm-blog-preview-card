## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile responsiveness

### What I learned

I attempted to learn more semantic html and utilize named 
elements vs using all divs. I also learned more about CSS
functions and tried to impliment these in the font size
responsiveness. Example:
```css
.card > p {
    font-weight: 100;
    font-size: clamp(.6rem, 1.5vw, 2rem);
}
```
